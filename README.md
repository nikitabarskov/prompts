## How this repository is organized

Each folder in this repository is a specific actor when I use LLM.
In each folder you will find actions related to that actor.

## Writer

Writer is an actor that helps me write technical content. I do not use it to
generate ideas or brainstorming, but I do use it to review and edit my work.

> [!NOTE]
> Even the very this README.md file is written with assistance of writer.
